# Ammo.js-PID-Car-Steering-Control-
Educational PID Car Steering Control Experiment

In light of the global pandemic as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2, the importance of educational access and online learning has been stressed with students of all ages learning from home. This report details the creation of a experiment to teach closed-loop PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative) control to students. The controller algorithm was developed in JavaScript featuring cascade control. A web-browser based simulation using the unique Ammo.js physics engine in conjunction with the Three.js 3D graphics library for the WebGL environment. The scenario of a car changing lanes was determined as the context for the experiment. Its steering angle being the manipulated variable and its lateral position the process variable. A ray cast vehicle was generated as the car for the experiment with control over its parameters. The system was tuned using the Ziegler-Nichols closed-loop continuous cycling method. A graphical display was implemented as well as a live HTML interface, super-imposed process diagram, live chart, orbital camera and framerate tracker. The vehicle also draws a ribbon along its path illustrating its control response.
